Compsets

Overview
========

CESM's component models can be run in a variety of combinations, ranging from
all components being active to all components being off. A given set of 
component configurations is known as a "component set" or "compset" for short.

Similar compsets are grouped using aliases. The CESM2 documentation `provides a
table <https://escomp.github.io/CESM/versions/cesm2.1/html/cesm_configurations.html#cesm2-component-sets>`_
showing which components are active.

Coupled data assimilation experiments typically use compsets with aliases
beginning with ``B``, since the atmosphere, land, sea ice and ocean components
are all active in these compsets.

The CESM website provides a `comprehensive list of all available compsets
<https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/cesm/compsets.html>`_.
