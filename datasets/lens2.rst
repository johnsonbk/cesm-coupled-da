CESM2 Large Ensemble
####################

The `CESM2 Large Ensemble (LENS2) <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/LENS2/>`_
is a 100-member ~1.0Â° ensemble covering the period 1850-2100. It provides
restart files that can be used to initialize a CESM ensemble. 

The ensemble is constructed in a way that samples internal variability
throughout an extended pre-industrial control simulation:

.. 
   
   **Members 11-90**: "The chosen start dates (model years 1231, 1251, 1281, &
   1301) sample AMOC and sea surface height (SSH) in the Labrador Sea at their
   maximum, minimum, and transition states."
